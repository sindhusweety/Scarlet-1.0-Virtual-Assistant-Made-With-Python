# Scarlet-1.0-Virtual-Assistant-Made-With-Python
S.C.A.R.L.E.T (Sorta Crappy Assistant Robot Lazily Engineered Today) To be honest making up that acronym was easier than making this virtual assistant.'She' obeys some of the following commands:search + (what you want to search for),email-opens Gmail.What time is it?What date is it?Youtube-opens Youtube,shut down,Scarlet (check for responsiveness).This virtual assistant is very far from perfect but I hope to improve it as I continue to learn the deeper workings of the Python programming language. I could use some help with her later versions..
